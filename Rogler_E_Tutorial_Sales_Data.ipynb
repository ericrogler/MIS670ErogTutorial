    "# Modeling Sales Data with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be looking at sales data and conducting low scale marketing analytics based on information extracted from a dataset. For those entirely new to sales data, there is an explaining of the key columns after we import the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial is designed to work as a general tutorial for modeling sales data given within a structured data format at a small to medium scale.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Big data would require MapReduce and PySpark, which is not covered here. Another method of sorting through and storing the data is through the [SQLite package](http://pythoncentral.io/introduction-to-sqlite-in-python/), but we will be completing commands you can run with SQL code exclusively with Python as I'm assuming you, the reader, have no database to import tables to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of difficulty, this tutorial should be relatively easy to implement and understand. The hardest part would be understanding the terms in the dataset and applying it to the example problems provided within."

    "In sales data, there are several analysis techinques we may use. We can figure out the overall profit of each month by grouping together purchases made across a given timeframe and reporting which time periods were the best. You can also discover the percentage of discounts provided to each item when sold, as well as applying market segmentation on your customers (e.g. age, private/public sector, location, gender, etc.). Basket analysis--or affinity analysis--is another method used on data which looks at what items a consumer purchased as well as the methods used to make the purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What type of decisions you can make from this dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find out how well your company is doing in terms of profits. You can figure out the range of discounts for all products and draw a correlation between profits and discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also figure out which areas to focus in, whether that would be allocating resources to a particular product, geographical location, or demographic. One can also determine the amount of product sold across all locations where the product is available. In addition to each product's sales, you can also figure out the average sale price within a given region or multiple regions at once, using only a few modules in Python and its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What techniques are applicable to other sales datasets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are a few things applicable to *this* example dataset in the notebook, you can also perform many more analysis techniques on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can examine data from customer purchase histories to figure out forecasts and trends on data. You can take information from call centers, segment down each individual into certain \"segments\"--whether it be based on personality, behavior, or another metric--and perform individual analysis on each segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most companies also conduct \"Predictive Analytics,\" where information in a dataset is used to generate a forecast to predict many items, such as demand, whether there is a seasonal effect, and figuring out potential pitfalls with current products. Predictive Analytics is also useful for advising managers and higher ups on future decisions for the business as well as identifying red flags and mistakes the company could be making.\n",

Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and easy to read data structures (specifically structured, not semi-structured or unstructured). It translates well from an SQL table and Excel, both in importing and exporting. This tutorial will feature both Series (1D data structures, where it shows a key and single value as an output rather than a separate column) and Dataframes (2D data structures, where information is neatly sorted into multiple columns/rows).\n",
